Ben & Connor’s programming ideas

1) Skillshot game (basically shoot lasers at each other)  possibly java if we make it 2d, unity and google cardboard for 3d?
2) Make up our own strategy game with whatever system of hitpoints and spells you can load up in a deck.
3) First person missile command (unity, look up and shoot at falling meteors?)
4) First person maze solving
5) 360 degree music visualizer
6) simple card game similar to rock paper scissors
