Ben & Connorâ€™s programming ideas

1) Skillshot game (basically shoot lasers at each other)  possibly java if we make it 2d, unity and google cardboard for 3d?
2) Make up our own strategy game with whatever system of hitpoints and spells you can load up in a deck.
3) First person missile command (unity, look up and shoot at falling meteors?)
4) First person maze solving
5) 360 degree music visualizer
6) simple card game similar to rock paper scissors
7) Typing war - type against each other
	Keep the keyboard on phone up at all times, type to attack, defend, power up, 	etc, have some visuals, 
	and you need to type to react. strategy game with energy to use skills
8) This one would be really hard, 3d graphing calculator
